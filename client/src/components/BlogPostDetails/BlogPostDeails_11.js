        The last few days have seen the CBN's letter prohibiting financial
        institutions from facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchanges
        receive wild reactions from the general public. The content of the
        letter itself isn't new and meant only to reiterate the Apex bank's
        position on cryptocurrency exchange and related activities expressed as
        far back as 2017. According to the recent letter non-compliance with
        this directive will incur severe sanctions. The ban is perplexing
        considering just recently in September 2020 the Nigerian Securities and
        Exchange Commission announced plans to formulate a legal framework for
        cryptocurrencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot has been speculated and espoused by various media outlets about
        the government's motivation for the ban. But let&rsquo;s assume the
        best-case scenario, that the Nigerian government is doing this in the
        best interest of its citizenry, a ban is still not the answer. Even
        worse, it is counterproductive.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <p>
        At this point, no one can deny the dark side of cryptocurrency. It has
        played a huge role in crimes of all sorts. From its use in financial
        crimes including Ponzi schemes and money laundering to terrorist
        financing, cryptocurrency has been a desired tool for men of the
        underworld.
      </p>
      <p>
        But is this enough justification for a ban? The objective answer is No.
        That is the stance of many first-world countries like the United States,
        Canada, Japan, and Australia who have taken steps to engage or
        legitimize cryptocurrency in their countries. A country like Nigeria
        with all its potential for economic and technological dominance in
        Africa and beyond must do the same.&nbsp;
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <p>
        For an instance on why formulating laws that prevent innovation in the
        crypto space isn't the answer, look no further than Fiat currencies. If
        cases of illicit transactions in Fiat currency do not attract a
        permanent blanket ban, why should cryptocurrency?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong>A crypto ban is counterproductive</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Of course, there are broader arguments why a &lsquo;cryptocurrency
        ban&rsquo; is counterproductive to any country.&nbsp; Recall,
        Cryptocurrency since its inception in 2009 has proven to be a truly
        revolutionary invention. Built on the back of blockchain technology,
        cryptocurrency allows borderless transactions with no need for a third
        party amongst other benefits of decentralized systems. This technology
        has seen further applications in other industries:&nbsp; land
        verification in real estate niche, effective digital voting, etc. Indeed
        Blockchain-based solutions can help improve several sectors in Nigeria.
        Stifling the growth of cryptocurrencies in the country will have a
        domino effect on other blockchain-related innovations too preventing
        healthy growth of the space.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Again, technology and innovation like cryptocurrency are cornerstones of
        the fourth industrial revolution, and any country that wants a seat at
        the table should not meet innovation with inexplicable fear. As is often
        the case early adoption of new technology could pave the way to
        influence the development of the technology and reap financial and
        economic benefits. Cryptocurrency and blockchain are no exception. This
        is why countries like Japan have moved to create a positive regulatory
        climate for cryptocurrency.&nbsp; A crypto ban will stifle investment
        which could have contributed to the growth of the Nigerian economy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        At a time when Africa is hoping for a seat at the table in matters of
        technology and innovation, this ban will only set Nigeria back. This,
        considering the interest in cryptocurrency, has been incredibly high in
        the country. In fact, based on data from Google trend Nigeria ranks as
        the most interested in cryptocurrency globally. Record from active
        crypto countries in Nigeria also witnessed transaction volumes
        surpassing the 1 billion dollar mark. With such huge demand, investors
        all over the world will be looking to do business in Nigeria's
        cryptocurrency and blockchain market leading to a boon in the economy.
        If there's any country in need of a magic wand to resuscitate its
        economy, it is Nigeria &ndash; a country that might face its worst
        recession in years as a fall-out from the still ravaging COVID-19
        pandemic. This ban preventing banks from doing business with
        cryptocurrency companies couldn&rsquo;t have come at a worse time.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Can a crypto ban be effective?</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Nigeria is not the first to implement laws that will outlaw
        cryptocurrency. The country needs to learn from other countries that
        have hastily implemented such bans and have had to rescind their
        decision years later. If cryptocurremcy has taught us anything, it is
        the fact that it cannot be stopped.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The past decade of its existence has seen it survive several
        unflattering labels by crypto naysayers. It was called a bubble, a Ponzi
        scheme, a currency for criminals, and many more.&nbsp; But none of this
        has slowed its growth and now it has the attention of the world.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Resistance against technology and innovation isn&rsquo;t new. The U.S
        once resisted the adoption of the internet. Even paper currency
        wasn&rsquo;t immediately embraced. Yet these inventions changed the
        world forever. But only because what was considered status quo was
        jettisoned and new innovations were embraced in the face of objective
        reasons.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Cryptocurrency is far too useful to be ignored. Nigeria should not be
        deprived of such once in a generation opportunity.&nbsp;
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>
          As a fall-out from the ban, many top-tier crypto exchanges will now be
          forced to restrict Nigerians from many of their services.&nbsp;
        </strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        But a ban cannot stop cryptocurrency growth in Nigeria. Sadly, it also
        cannot deter misuse of cryptocurrencies. Banning banks from doing
        business with crypto exchanges only increases the chances of individuals
        being forced to buy and sell crypto outside any legitimate platforms
        like{" "}
        <strong>
          <em>DafriXchange</em>
        </strong>
        . Because of the pseudonymous nature of crypto transactions, detecting
        violations of the CBN directive will be difficult without involving
        exchange platforms.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Here's why.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Cryptocurrency exchanges like{" "}
        <strong>
          <em>DafriXchange</em>
        </strong>{" "}
        serve as gatekeepers of the cryptocurrency industry by providing a
        structure to engage with the cryptocurrency market safely. Prohibiting
        their existence will be disastrous for everyone. Without exchange
        platforms, peer to peer transactions will skyrocket and the government's
        greatest fears about the currency will be actualized- illegal activities
        will be rampant. According to Paxful, Nigeria is already the
        second-largest market in the world in P2P behind only the U.S.&nbsp;
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Proposed solution</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        One of the differences between fiat and cryptocurrency is regulation.
        When it comes to preventing cryptocurrency misuse,&nbsp; regulating
        cryptocurrency is a far better alternative than a ban. Partnering with
        top exchanges (e.g{" "}
        <strong>
          <em>DafriXchange</em>
        </strong>
        ) can help facilitate this. Most transactions happen through
        cryptocurrency exchanges. Ensuring they maintain a detailed KYC and
        proper documentation of all their users can help the government track
        people using cryptocurrency to facilitate illegal activities.&nbsp;
        Genuine Exchanges like{" "}
        <strong>
          <em>DafriXchange</em>
        </strong>{" "}
        are ready to cooperate with the government of any country in fishing out
        fraudulent users of cryptocurrencies. There is no reason to punish
        everyone for the activities of a few which is what an outright ban
        achieves. The Nigerian government should reach out to exchanges for
        dialogue towards risk-minimization for users engaging in crypto-related
        activities.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        More solutions. A legal framework for cryptocurrencies must be defined.
        This will help allay the government&rsquo;s fears about cryptocurrency.
        It will also protect Investors' interest. Other grey areas such as tax
        implications and the use of cryptocurrency as a legal tender must also
        be clarified.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reality is whether anyone likes it or not, cryptocurrency is here to
        stay. In light of this, regulation is the only answer worth considering
        in the best interest of everyone. Any permanent ban on cryptocurrency by
        the Nigerian government will only indicate a lack of understanding and
        preparedness for the force for positive change cryptocurrency
        embodies.&nbsp;

        <strong>
          At DafriGroup PLC (with subsidiaries including DafriXchange,
          DafriBank, DafriEstate, etc.), we believe the Central Bank of Nigeria
          will do the right thing by rescinding this ban.
