        The DafriBank is pleased to announce to the general public the start of
        its much anticipated token sales on native exchange DafriXchange. 70
        million DBA Currency units are available for sales during The 7-month
        long token sales which will conclude on September 15, 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last few weeks have witnessed a large throng of DBA community
        members and supporters complete their KYC and registration on
        DafriXchange in preparation for the token sales. All is set as the token
        sales commenced today.

        In several ways, this is a historic moment much similar to
        Bitcoin&rsquo;s inception. This is a giant leap towards a revolutionary
        African economy. No other African project better exemplifies the power
        for positive impact in the economy that the Digital Bank of Africa
        project embodies. DBA also has the special distinction of being the
        Pan-African cryptocurrency with the most number of use cases as it finds
        relevant application in a plethora of industries in the African market
        including Finance, Hospitality, Real Estate, Blockchain, and many more.

      <p>
        The Digital Bank of Africa project is set to affect change in the
        African economy ushering in a payment system like no other that
        simplifies payment processing while empowering every user. DBA also
        wishes to use this opportunity to reiterate the purpose of its token
        sales. It is not to capitalize the project or any of its subsidiaries.
        Rather it is designed to give equal opportunity to everyone to own the
        revolutionary DBA Currency and to decide its future. For instance,
        $1000.00 USD invested in DBA Currency today could grow into $280 000.00
        USD over the period of 4 years.

        "A lot of excitement is in the air and we have all earned that right.
        For the DBA team, we are thrilled because several months of unrivalled
        hard work and commitment to DBA excellence has got us to this point in
        our journey. For the DBA community, it is a celebration of the launch of
        a cryptocurrency they can truly call theirs. Says the project director,
        Ms. Catherine Anajemba
      </p>
      <p>
        "Together we celebrate the successful start of the sales of the DBA
        Currency today knowing that this is just the beginning. Now the real
        work begins as we continue to work to take DBA to uncharted territories.
        We will never rest on our laurels. Special thanks to our loyal community
        who have stayed with us all through this journey and continue to do so.
        These are the real heroes behind our successful sales launch. At the end
        of the day, DBA is the people's currency and its growth will be
        community-driven" She added
