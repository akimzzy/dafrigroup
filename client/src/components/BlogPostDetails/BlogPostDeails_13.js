        No doubt that digital assets, crypto- blockchain are some of the biggest
        inventions of a century. A brand with a long term vision to stay afloat
        should either begin to draw a framework that will pave a way for future
        integration of such innovation or lose the race to competitors.

        Last year we demonstrated our enthusiasm for DafriGroup's spread of
        fintech and digital asset by investing accumulative total of R205
        million in DafriBank, DBA Currency, and DafriXchange respectively and
        this trend is expected to continue this year with increase in our
        digital asset holdings where an additional $25 million dollars purchase
        of various startup blockchain companies shares, token and digital asset
        was put into motion while downsizing our brick and mortar business
        interests.

        Other global leading companies have also taken this route with electric
        car giant Tesla who invested $1.5 Billion in Bitcoin early this year
        having reportedly seen some massive gains from its Bitcoin (BTC)
        investment. An analyst at Wedbush Securities, a private investment firm
        in the United States, has calculated that Tesla has made “roughly $1
        billion” in the aftermath of its $1.5 billion Bitcoin investment.

        A recent surge in BNB - Binance price helped increase our portfolio
        value to R950 million with an all time high of R1.7 billion witnessed on
        22 February 2021. Our long term projection on BNB remains at $1200 per
        unit.

        As a public company, these actions increased your share value in
        DafriGroup without requiring you to so much as touch your wallet.

        It opens new opportunities for the rising African digital entrepreneurs,
        an oft-ignored niche. The bank uses advanced technologies that will
        allow access to a wide range of financial services without entry
        barriers. It will house the best digital banking systems providing
        payment solutions to an array of businesses and platforms.

        Not to be confused as a crypto company, but a bank that embraced a value
        proposition offered by crypto currencies; especially with it own digital
        crypto currency, "DBA Currency" and an integrated option that will
        enable its clients to seamlessly buy, store and exchange a selected
        number of cryptocurrencies right in their DafriBank app

        DBA Currency &trade;
        <br />
        <br />A Digital Asset product of DafriBank which is supported by all
        DafriGroup companies. What does this mean? Fiat currency is on the blink
        of losing its sovereignty, hence you see many central banks
        contemplating or have taken the decision to launch their own digital
        currency. With conscious knowledge of this impending reality, DafriBank
        did not want to be a follower but to lead the way. This is why we built
        our own digital currency backed by a real company with multiple
        subsidiaries. What I'm saying is, don't leave your money in fiat,
        exchange your fiat into digital assets. I'm not imploring you to buy or
        invest in DBA because I have an interest in it. But you can do your own
        research to decide if it worth it.

        DafriXchange &trade;

        <br />
        To further walk the Crypto blockchain talk, we launched DafriXchange to
        become the group Crypto Exchange outlet that has begun to change the way
        cryptocurrencies are moved in Africa. DafriXchange is African
        cryptocurrency exchange helping to build a new financial system that
        recognises the oneness of humanity. It became the first Exchange in the
        world to implement a Payment Agent (PA) system in its platform, a
        groundbreaking feature that avails our services and products in 200
        countries of which 53 of are african countries. DafriXchange adopted DBA
        as a native token across its ecosystem.
