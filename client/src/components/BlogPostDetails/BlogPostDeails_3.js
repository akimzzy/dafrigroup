            The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified in South Africa with a 21-day period of lockdown which officially began this week. To assist the on-ground battle against the virus, Xolane Ndhlovu through his company UMEH Group Proprietary Limited has pledged an immediate donation of R500000.00 to support President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Solidarity Response Fund.
            <br/><br/>
            COVID-19, a deadly virus first reported in Wuhan, China, in November 2019 has wreaked havoc and brought the global economy to a standstill. So far, around 39000 people have died from viral infection and more than 500 000 have been infected around the world.
            <br/><br/>
            In addition to the R500000.00 donation, we also plan to support the on-ground efforts for the underprivileged section in various communities through steps that are necessary for providing the right level of hygiene in line with the guidelines set by the Department of Health. These include the distribution of products like sanitizers, soaps, and masks, as well as food supply to boost various families who have been deprived of their livelihood by the impact of the virus.

            In his address, Xolane Ndhlovu, the UMEH Group chairman said, “Covid-19 pandemic is a global emergency and combatting it is everybody’s social responsibility. This requires a coordinated mode of action between the private sector and the government, functioning assiduously to stem the transmission rate of the virus within the country. I am hopeful that this humble contribution will bring some relief to the vulnerable communities and households as the battle against getting rid of the ravaging epidemic progresses to a higher pitch. The citizens of South Africa have always shown incredible strength and resilience in the face of many challenges and this sets us apart as a nation. I am fully confident in our capabilities and believe that we will win this battle with your support and cooperation with the state. My plead to everyone is to adhere to the rules and guidelines provided by the Department of Health and other authorized institutions during this crucial period”.

            UMEH Group is a multinational conglomerate with a portfolio of interest across 16 subsidiaries.
